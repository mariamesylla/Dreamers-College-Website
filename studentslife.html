          I was fortunate enough to create an application from scratch as soon as I came to the company. The concepts from the project management courses were much needed during this experience. The course allowed me to manage my time efficiently, identify necessary recourses, create and adjust timelines and also effectively communicate the process and status to stakeholders. The software development methodologies, discussed in detail in the Intro to Software Engineering course, were utilized in order to decide which methodology would be better for my first project. ”

          When we started working with The Lonely Entrepreneur, we were definitely on to something in pet telemedicine. But we were all over the place.  And the stresses of bringing the vision to life were growing. Having The Lonely Entrepreneur to call on when I needed them (sometimes in the middle of the night) meant everything. And we set priorities, goals and managed the team.  And now are considered the pioneers of the pet telemedicine industry.

 The Lonely Entrepreneur team has a unique understanding of how an early stage company works and how a founder with skills need to transition to being a founder that runs a business. They have helped me all over – go to market, selecting vendors, setting priorities and staying sane along the way
